Hey there, <br>

If you're pressed for time, feel free to check out my website directly at - https://jahanvi-dev.github.io/mind-mosaic-project-2/ .<br>

Mind Mosaic is my second project, where I've asked users three thought-provoking life questions. These are questions we should all reflect on, which is why I created this website. While it's still a work in progress, I’m excited to continue learning backend development and add more functionality in the future. <br>

I’d love to hear your thoughts on it!
